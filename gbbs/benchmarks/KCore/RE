# Parallel Static Approximate k-Core Decomposition
--------

This repository contains the implementations for our
approximate, static k-core algorithm.

`ApproxKCore/` contains the implementations for our parallel, static,
approximate k-core algorithm. Specifically, it contains the
implementation for our parallel, static,
![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%282&plus;%5Cvarepsilon%29)-approximate
k-core decomposition algorithm, while `Julienne` contains our implementation of the sequential 
level data structure of [Henzinger, Neumann, and Wiese](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.10142) 
but adapted to output core numbers.
