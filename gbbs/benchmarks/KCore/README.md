# Parallel Static Approximate k-Core Decomposition
--------

This repository contains the implementations for parallel static k-core decomposition algorithms.

`ApproximateKCore/` contains the
implementation for our parallel, static,
![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%282&plus;%5Cvarepsilon%29)-approximate
k-core decomposition algorithm, while `JulienneDBS17/` contains the implementation of the parallel,
exact, k-core decomposition algorithm of 
[Dhulipala, Blelloch, and Shun](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3087556.3087580).
